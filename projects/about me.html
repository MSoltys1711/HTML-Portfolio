<h1>ðŸ’­About MeðŸ’­</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi! ,<br> My name is Magda and I am learning to become a Full Stack Web Developer. Previously, I was a working as a midwife but I have always had a longing for the IT industry and I am now making it a reality! </p>

<p>My partner is a Software Developer and he is an incredible support in my learning process. The learning route I have chosen is through a Udemy course that is packed with knowledge and projects. This small website is part of my learning journey and the beginning of my Portfolio where I showcase my skillset.</p>

<p>As the course progresses, I hope to fill my page with exciting content to prove that it is possible to learn web development at the comfort of your own home and to physically see the amazing progress I make!</p>
