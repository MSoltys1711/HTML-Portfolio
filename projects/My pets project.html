<p>This is Lacey. Lacey is a mix of a Rough and Border Collie. Lacey was taken in from a farmer that was going to put her in a dog shelter. </p>
<p>Lacey is the most loyal and obedient dog anyone could ever meet. One of her favourite words is 'field' and don't even get me started on how amazing she is at catching ball! Lacey was born in 2010 and although she is getting older, she is a true pup! </p>
